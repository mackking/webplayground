# Web Playground 

General collection of miscelaneous mini web projects/playground stuff. These things will likely live here until they warrent spawning off into their own repo.

**Note:** Full contents of this repo lives in the `gh-pages` branch and so auto-deploys to [http://mackking.github.io/webplayground/](http://mackking.github.io/webplayground/). Look there to check out all the demos live.
